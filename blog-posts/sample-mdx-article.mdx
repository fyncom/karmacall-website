Welcome to the new MDX-powered blog system! This article demonstrates how you can write content in **Markdown/MDX** and it automatically gets converted to our sophisticated JavaScript blog format.

> 📝 **Quick Start:** Simply write your article in MDX format with proper frontmatter, and our converter will handle the rest - including social sharing optimization!

## Why MDX for Blog Posts?

MDX offers several advantages for content creation:

- **Easy Writing**: Use familiar Markdown syntax
- **Better Social Sharing**: Featured images display properly on social platforms
- **Component Integration**: Mix Markdown with React components when needed
- **Automatic Conversion**: Seamlessly integrates with our existing blog infrastructure

### Social Media Benefits

One of the key problems this solves is **social media sharing**. When you share a link to an MDX-generated article:

1. Featured images appear correctly in social previews
2. Meta descriptions are properly set
3. Open Graph tags are automatically generated
4. Twitter Cards work seamlessly

## Writing Features

### Callout Boxes

The converter automatically recognizes special markdown patterns and converts them to styled callout boxes:

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Any blockquote that starts with an emoji and bold text becomes a beautiful callout box!

> ⚠️ **Important:** Warning callouts get special styling to draw attention to critical information.

### Code Blocks

```javascript
// Code blocks are automatically styled
const converter = new MDXConverter({
  outputFormat: 'javascript',
  preserveFormatting: true
});

converter.process('sample-article.mdx');
```

### Lists and Structure

The system preserves your content structure:

1. **Ordered lists** maintain numbering
2. **Nested content** works perfectly
3. **Mixed formatting** is supported

- Bullet points are styled consistently
- Links work both [internally](/blog) and [externally](https://example.com)
- **Bold** and *italic* text is preserved

## Advanced Features

### Automatic Table of Contents

The converter automatically generates a table of contents from your H2 and H3 headings, creating smooth-scrolling navigation in the sidebar.

### Text Size Controls

Readers can adjust text size for better readability - all handled automatically by our existing blog infrastructure.

### Related Articles

The system automatically suggests related articles based on keywords and content similarity.

## Behind the Scenes

Here's what happens when you save an MDX file:

1. **Frontmatter Parsing**: The converter extracts metadata (title, description, etc.)
2. **Content Conversion**: Markdown is converted to JSX with proper styling
3. **Component Integration**: Your content is wrapped in our blog components
4. **Database Updates**: Article listings are automatically updated
5. **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags and social sharing are configured

### Frontmatter Requirements

Every MDX article needs these frontmatter fields:

- `title`: Your article title (appears in browser tab and social shares)
- `description`: SEO description (150-160 characters optimal)
- `author`: Author name
- `date`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `slug`: URL path (must start with `/blog/`)

Optional fields:
- `featuredImage`: Path to hero image for social sharing
- `keywords`: Array of SEO keywords

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post:

1. Create a `.mdx` file in the `blog-posts/` directory
2. Add proper frontmatter at the top
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Save the file - conversion happens automatically in watch mode!

The converter will:
- Generate a JavaScript file in `src/pages/blog/`
