              KarmaCall (hereinafter: Application) is a piece of software created to block malicious spam calls through a financial filter that pays users to
              ignore unknown calls. This is customized for Google and Apple mobile devices. It is used to block spam calls while allowing unknown callers to
              make refundable micro-deposits in order to authenticate themselves to you.
              <br />
              <br />
              Furthermore, it is used to Earn and withdraw <a href="https://nano.org/">Nano cryptocurrency</a> while allowing the option to cash out to gift
              cards.
              <br />
              <br />
              While the Application follows general privacy policy standards (see our <Link to="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link>), the Application is not
              tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security
              Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Application. You may not use the
              Application in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
