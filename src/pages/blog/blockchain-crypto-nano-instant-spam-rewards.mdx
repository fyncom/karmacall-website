You block a spam call with KarmaCall, and instantly, you see a reward in your account. It feels like magic. But behind that seamless experience is a powerful technology that makes it all possible. Many of our users have asked: **"Are you using crypto for this?"**

The answer is yes. But more importantly, we chose a specific type of cryptocurrency that is uniquely suited for our mission. Here's a look under the hood at why nano (XNO) is the secret engine that powers KarmaCall.

## The Problem: Pennies Have Paperwork

To build a system where unknown callers make a small, refundable deposit (what we call a <Link to="/white-paper-original-scam-calls">NanoDeposit</Link>), we needed a way to move tiny amounts of money instantly and for free.

Think about it: if an unknown sender forfeits a $0.05 deposit, but it costs $0.30 in credit card fees to process it, the entire economic model collapses. Traditional financial systems are built for dollars, not fractions of a cent. They are too slow and too expensive for the hundreds of trillions micro-transactions we need to work across all digital communication channels.

**We needed a payment system that could operate at the speed and scale of the internet itself.**

## Our Wishlist for a Payment System

When we designed the FynCom protocol, we created a strict checklist for the financial backbone that would power it. The platform had to be:

<div style={{
  background: "var(--color-background-alt, #f8fafc)",
  padding: "1.5rem",
  borderRadius: "8px",
  marginBottom: "1.5rem",
  border: "1px solid var(--border-color, #e2e8f0)",
}}>

1. **Fee-free** â€” no transaction costs eating into micro-rewards
2. **Real-time** â€” instant settlement, not hours or days
3. **No fees to open new wallets** â€” accessible to everyone
4. **Scalable** â€” able to handle trillions of transactions
5. **Lightweight** â€” won't drain your phone's battery or our developer's sanity
6. **Decentralized** â€” remains open and fair for all

</div>

This wasn't just a wishlist; these were **non-negotiable requirements**. Without every single one of these features, the user experience would suffer, and our mission to create an economic filter against spam would fail.

## Why Nano (XNO) Was the Perfect Fit ðŸª™

After reviewing many options, we found one platform that checked every box: **nano (XNO)**.

### It's Truly Feeless

This is the most critical feature. When a spammer's $0.05 deposit is forfeited, **you keep the full reward**. There are no network fees, processing fees, or hidden charges that take a cut. Feeless transactions make our economic model viable.

### It's Lightning Fast

Nano transactions are confirmed in **under a second**. This "real-time settlement" is why you see your reward instantly. There's no waiting for a bank to clear a payment. That speed provides immediate positive feedback and builds trust in the system.

### It's Scalable and Lightweight

Nano is designed to handle a high volume of transactions without the intense computational work that drains batteries on other crypto networks. This ensures the KarmaCall app remains efficient and non-intrusive on your device.

### It's Accessible

We create nano accounts for you when you sign up and attach that to your phone number or email, which allows us to instantly set up crypto-enabled accounts for all KarmaCall users **without any "buy-in" needed**. This removes a major barrier to adoption.

<div style={{
  background: "var(--color-background-alt, #ecfdf5)",
  padding: "1.5rem",
  borderRadius: "8px",
  marginBottom: "1.5rem",
  border: "1px solid var(--karmacall-green, #10b981)",
}}>

**The Perfect Combination**

This powerful combination of features in nano allows us to run the time-based escrow system at the heart of KarmaCall: refunding honest callers instantly while ensuring spammers lose their deposit, with you getting the reward.

Since we made that choice in 2020, other blockchain ecosystems have emerged, which have amazing communities who we'd like to serveâ€”so there's always options to add other cryptocurrencies into our workflow thanks to the way we built our platform.

## You Don't Need to Be a Crypto Expert to Benefit

While this cutting-edge technology powers our app, we designed KarmaCall so that **you don't need to understand cryptocurrency to use it**.

We handle all the complexity in the background. And while the native reward is in nano, we're making it easier than ever to use your earnings. In KarmaCall 4.0 and beyond, we're rolling out options to:

- **Cash out your rewards** as popular gift cards for Amazon and more
- **Transfer to services** like Venmo
- **Convert to other cryptocurrencies** as we expand our supported networks

Our goal is simple: to stop spam, end digital fraud, and reward you for your time. The technology is just the means to that end. **nano provides the perfect financial rails for this new, more respectful internet we're building**, one where your attention has value.
