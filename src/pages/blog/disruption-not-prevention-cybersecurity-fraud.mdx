**At a recent cybersecurity conference, a Google Threat Intelligence leader delivered a message that should fundamentally change how we think about fighting fraud: "We cannot make intel sharing the goal. The goal has to be disruption."**

This isn't just semantic difference. It represents a complete shift in philosophy from **defensive prevention** to **proactive disruption** which explains why traditional approaches to fighting the $442 billion global scam crisis (<Link to="/blog/global-scam-crisis-2025-economic-defense">we've documented</Link>) are failing.

## The Scale Google Sees: Billions with a B

When Google acquired Mandiant, the threat intelligence team gained something unprecedented: visibility into threats affecting "billions with a B" users across the entire Alphabet ecosystem.

From that vantage point, they're watching something that should terrify us all: **the rapid adoption of AI by threat actors is happening faster than the adoption of AI for defense**.

### What Google is Tracking:

- **AI-powered social engineering** (better phishing, sophisticated deepfakes)
- **"vibe coding"** (natural language malware creation lowering barriers to entry)
- **automated intrusion activity** (AI making real-time hacking decisions)
- **AI-powered vulnerability research** (automated zero-day discovery)
- **malware that calls AI models** for commands (seen in the wild from Russian military)

</div>

This isn't theoretical research. This is happening right now in active cyber operations across the globe.

## The $25 Million Deepfake: When Video Calls Can't Be Trusted

Perhaps the most chilling example Google shared: **a finance worker paid out $25 million after having a video call with a deepfake CFO**.

Think about that for a moment. The worker followed all the best practices:

- verified the request in a video call ✓
- saw the CFO's face in real-time ✓
- heard the CFO's voice ✓
- observed appropriate business context ✓

**and still lost $25 million to fraud.**

This is the fundamental problem with prevention-based thinking: when AI can eliminate every "warning sign" we've trained people to watch for, human judgment becomes the weakest link, not a reliable defense.

## How The "Big Four" Nation-States Are Using AI

Google tracks threat actor use of their Gemini AI model across the globe, revealing fascinating patterns:

### Iran: The Power Users

Iranian threat actors are trying to maximize Gemini's capabilities for:

- **content localization** into English and Hebrew
- **military research** (anti-drone tech, F-35 platforms)
- **coding and scripting tasks**

They're essentially using AI as an enhanced search engine combined with a development assistant.

### China: Vulnerability Hunters

China-based threat actors are focused on:

- **vulnerability research** at scale
- **reverse engineering** popular EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools
- **real-time intrusion assistance** (using AI to suggest next steps during active hacks)

That last point is particularly significant: imagine hacking into a network and when you reach a decision point, you ask an AI "what should I do next?" and it gives you tactical advice based on the current state of your intrusion. **that's happening now.**

### North Korea: The Employment Scam at Scale

This one sounds almost unbelievable, but Google confirms it's very real: **North Korean IT workers are successfully getting hired at Fortune 500 companies across the world**.

How they're pulling it off:

- **AI-generated false documents** that pass initial screening
- **deepfake profile images** that look completely legitimate
- **hired intermediaries** to do video interviews (or deepfake the interviews)
- **laptop farms** that make it appear workers are in the U.S. when they're not

One North Korean operative in Europe was discovered to have **nine different personas and was recommending themselves to each other** within the same company.

The implications:

- yes, they're raising money for nuclear programs
- **but more importantly:** they now have privileged access inside hundreds, maybe thousands, of companies worldwide
- this is pre-positioning for future cyber operations or conflict

### Russia: AI-Powered Malware in Ukraine

The first confirmed case of AI-powered malware in the wild: Russian military malware that **calls out via API to a Chinese large language model to generate commands on the fly**.

Why this matters:

- **defeats static malware analysis** (can't analyze code that doesn't exist yet)
- **adapts in real-time** to defensive measures
- **frustrates incident response** by generating unique behavior per infection

## The Confidence Gap: Why Smart People Fall for Scams

Here's the paradox Google's data reveals:

- **73% of adults globally** feel confident in their ability to recognize scams
- **yet 57% still experienced a scam** in the past year

The #1 reason victims cite for being deceived? **"the scam was very realistic/believable"** (21% of victims).

### Ineffective Tactics People Rely On:

Most common verification methods that **AI now defeats**:

- checking for spelling/grammar errors (27% use this): _AI eliminates this signal_
- looking for reviews on the same website (24%): _easily faked_
- checking if company is on social media (21%): _trivial to create_

Even high-effectiveness tactics like "too good to be true" rules and independent review checks fail against **sophisticated, AI-powered personalization at scale**.

## The Good News: AI vs. AI

Google isn't just documenting the problem. They're fighting back with AI, and they're starting to win specific battles.

### Project "Big Sleep"

Google DeepMind and Project Zero collaborated on an AI system that proactively scans for vulnerabilities:

**November 2024:** found their first vulnerability that humans likely wouldn't have discovered in any reasonable timeframe.

**A few months later:** the real breakthrough.

### The SQLite Zero-Day Story

This is the kind of disruption that changes the game:

1. Google detected chatter in underground forums about a planned zero-day attack on SQLite (widely-used open-source database software)
2. They **did not know what the vulnerability was**
3. They deployed the "Big Sleep" AI to analyze SQLite source code
4. **AI found the vulnerability** before the threat actors could exploit it
5. Google reached out to SQLite team to patch it
6. **vulnerability neutralized before a single attack**

This is disruption, not prevention. They didn't wait to detect an attack and respond. They **proactively eliminated the attack vector** before it could be weaponized.

## The Intel Sharing Trap

Here's where the Google leader's message becomes crucial for everyone in cybersecurity:

> "We have talked a lot in the past decade about info sharing and intel sharing... Looking at the statistics and looking at the rise of ransomware, the rise of espionage, and what we're going to be up against with the AI threat landscape in the future, it's going to be really critical that **we move beyond intel sharing as if that's the goal**."

### Why Intel Sharing Isn't Enough:

- **we haven't gotten anywhere** using that mentality
- ransomware has **increased** despite better intel sharing
- espionage has **evolved** despite threat intelligence
- AI threats are **accelerating** faster than intel can keep up

### The Real Goal: Disruption

> "Intelligence is for decision makers to do something. It's not just to be the smartest people in the room about threats."

**Google now has a dedicated disruption unit** that:

- looks for **partners** to collaborate on takedowns
- finds **opportunities** to disrupt threat actor activity proactively
- operates **legally and ethically** with appropriate authorities
- does this **at scale** with willing industry partners

The philosophy: **stop trying to be smart about threats. Start trying to eliminate threats.**

## Why This Matters for the Scam Crisis

Google's philosophy shift from prevention to disruption directly applies to the global scam epidemic.

### Traditional Scam Prevention Asks:

- how do we **identify** scammers?
- how do we **educate** consumers?
- how do we **detect** fraud faster?
- how do we **respond** more effectively?

### Disruptive Scam Defense Asks:

- how do we make **scamming unprofitable**?
- how do we **eliminate** the economic model?
- how do we **preempt** contact before manipulation begins?
- how do we **change the fundamental math**?

  marginBottom: "1.5rem",
  border: "1px solid var(--karmacall-gold, #f59e0b)",
}}>

**⚡ the key insight:** just as Google uses AI to find vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them, economic incentives can make scam operations impossible before they reach victims.

</div>

## How KarmaCall Disrupts, Not Just Prevents

KarmaCall applies the same "disruption over prevention" philosophy to communication fraud:

### Prevention Approach (Traditional):

- **reactive:** detect scam after it arrives
- **relies on:** human judgment to recognize threats
- **requires:** constant updates as scams evolve
- **outcome:** reduces some fraud, but scammers adapt

### Disruption Approach (KarmaCall):

- **proactive:** changes economics before scam can start
- **relies on:** math that scammers can't bypass
- **requires:** nothing from users except initial setup
- **outcome:** makes the scam business model unprofitable

### The RefundableDeposit™ Disruption:

<div style={{
  background: "var(--color-background-alt, #ecfdf5)",
  padding: "1.5rem",
  borderRadius: "8px",
  marginBottom: "1.5rem",
  border: "1px solid var(--karmacall-green, #10b981)",
}}>

**how it disrupts scam economics:**

1. **unknown callers deposit** tiny amounts (e.g., $0.001)
2. **legitimate callers get refunded** when you engage (25+ second conversation)
3. **scam calls aren't engaged with** so deposits aren't refunded
4. **scammers must pay per attempt** at scale
5. **low response rates** {'(<1%)'} make mass scamming economically impossible

**why this is disruption:**

- doesn't require detecting fraud (works before contact)
- doesn't rely on human judgment (math can't be socially engineered)
- doesn't need constant updates (economics don't change)
- doesn't wait for someone to get scammed (preemptive by design)

</div>

### Legitimate Business Communications Benefit:

Just like Google's Big Sleep helps legitimate software by finding vulnerabilities first, KarmaCall's economics help legitimate businesses by:

- **providing instant authentication** (deposit demonstrates commitment)
- **building trust** (refund proves good faith)
- **reducing friction** for genuine communication
- **creating positive ROI** (small deposit refunded = customer acquisition cost)

## The "Before Times" Warning

Google's leader offered a sobering prediction:

> "I really do believe we're in the before times... As this technology gets better, we're going to see more sophisticated uses, and that automated vulnerability scanning and identification that can be done at scale can really create something that is different in the threat landscape than we've ever seen before."

### What "Before Times" Means:

**right now:**

- AI-powered threats exist but haven't fundamentally changed incident response
- companies aren't seeing surges in intrusions
- "it's still about making sure that you've patched your vulnerabilities. it's still about not clicking on things. it's still about the basics."

**coming soon:**

- **automated vulnerability exploitation** at unprecedented scale
- **AI-powered attacks** that adapt faster than humans can respond
- **threat landscape transformation** requiring new defensive paradigms

The parallel to scams:

- **right now:** AI makes scams more believable, but basic caution still helps
- **coming soon:** AI personalization so sophisticated that human judgment fails entirely

**This is why we need disruptive solutions deployed before that future arrives.**

## The Three-Part Defense Strategy

Based on Google's insights, effective defense requires three layers:

### 1. Infrastructure-Level Disruption

**what Google is doing:** takedowns, proactive vulnerability patching, threat actor disruption

**what this looks like for scams:** economic barriers at the network level, deposit requirements across communication channels, carrier-level fraud economics

### 2. AI-Powered Preemptive Defense

**what Google is doing:** Big Sleep finding vulnerabilities before exploitation

**what this looks like for scams:** economic models that prevent contact before manipulation begins

### 3. Cross-Sector Collaboration

**what Google advocates:** industry partnerships for coordinated disruption

**what this looks like for scams:** businesses, platforms, and users all adopting economic incentives that align interests

## Why "The Basics" Won't Be Enough

Google emphasizes that right now, fundamentals still matter:

- patch your vulnerabilities
- don't click suspicious links
- use strong authentication

**but here's the critical caveat:** this only works "at this point." once AI-powered threats evolve further, basics become insufficient.

### For Scams, We're Already Past "Basics Work":

- **deepfake CFO** stole $25 million despite video call verification
- **57% global victimization** despite 73% confidence in scam recognition
- **$442 billion annual losses** despite widespread awareness campaigns

**We're already in the future where prevention isn't enough. We need disruption now.**

## The North Korean IT Worker Lesson

The North Korean employment scam reveals something profound about modern threats:

### What Traditional Security Would Do:

- try to **detect** fake resumes
- try to **identify** deepfake interviews
- try to **catch** false documents
- **reactive** at every step

### What Disruptive Security Would Do:

- require **economic verification** that persists over time
- demand **ongoing authentication** not just at hiring
- create **incentive structures** that make infiltration unprofitable
- **proactive** by changing the economics

This parallels scam calls perfectly:

- **prevention:** try to identify each scam call
- **disruption:** make scam calling economically impossible

## Real-World Proof: 500,000+ Disruptions

While Google is disrupting threats at the infrastructure level, KarmaCall is disrupting scam economics at the individual level:

- **500,000+ instant payments** to users for blocking scam calls
- **proven economic model** that makes mass scamming unprofitable
- **no reliance on detection** or human judgment
- **scales through adoption** not regulatory change

This is disruption in action, not just prevention theory.

## The Collaboration Imperative

Google's message about moving beyond intel sharing to active disruption partnerships applies to scam defense too.

### What Doesn't Work:

- sharing threat intelligence about known scammers ❌
- educating consumers about warning signs ❌
- waiting for platforms to improve detection ❌
- hoping regulators will enforce penalties ❌

### What Does Work:

- **coordinated economic barriers** across communication channels ✓
- **shared incentive structures** that align all parties ✓
- **proactive disruption** of scam business models ✓
- **technology that doesn't require perfect coordination** ✓

## The Choice: Defense or Disruption

Google's leader laid out the choice clearly for cybersecurity professionals. The same choice exists for scam defense:

### Defense Mindset:

- **goal:** stop threats we can detect
- **method:** improve detection and response
- **outcome:** perpetual arms race with attackers
- **trajectory:** falling behind as AI evolves

### Disruption Mindset:

- **goal:** make threats economically or technically impossible
- **method:** change fundamental attack economics or eliminate vulnerabilities proactively
- **outcome:** attackers must find entirely new vectors
- **trajectory:** compounding defensive advantage over time

## Taking Action: What You Can Do

Inspired by Google's disruption unit approach, here's how to move from prevention to disruption in your own scam defense:

### For Individuals:

1. stop relying on your ability to "spot" scams (AI defeats this)
2. <Link to="/pricing">adopt economic disruption tools</Link> that work regardless of scam sophistication
3. shift from "am I smart enough?" to "have I changed the economics?"

### For Businesses:

4. move from fraud detection to fraud economics
5. consider deposit-based communication to demonstrate legitimacy
6. participate in cross-sector disruption initiatives

### For The Ecosystem:

7. support companies building disruptive solutions, not just better detection
8. advocate for economic approaches that complement technical ones
9. collaborate on industry-wide adoption of economic barriers

## The "Smartest People in the Room" Problem

Google's critique of intel sharing culture applies to scam defense too:

> "Intelligence is for decision makers to do something. It's not just to be the smartest people in the room about threats."

### In Scam Defense, This Manifests As:

- Endless articles **documenting** the crisis
- Detailed **analysis** of scam tactics
- Sophisticated **reporting** on fraud trends
- **But limited actual disruption** of scam operations

### What Disruption Looks Like Instead:

- **Fewer** reports about the problem
- **More** deployment of solutions that change economics
- **Less** focus on being informed
- **More** focus on being protected

## Conclusion: The Paradigm Shift

Google's message at the conference represents a fundamental shift in cybersecurity thinking:

**old paradigm:**

- share intelligence → improve detection → respond faster → reduce some fraud

**new paradigm:**

- identify vulnerabilities → eliminate them before exploitation → disrupt threat actor operations → make entire attack vectors impossible

**For the $442 billion scam crisis, this means:**

- stop trying to **detect** every scam
- stop trying to **educate** every person
- stop trying to **respond** faster

**Start trying to:**

- **disrupt** scam economics
- **eliminate** mass communication vectors
- **preempt** contact before manipulation

  padding: "1.5rem",
  borderRadius: "8px",
  marginBottom: "1.5rem",
  border: "1px solid var(--border-color, #e2e8f0)",
}}>

### The Parallel is Exact:

Just as Google uses AI to find and patch vulnerabilities **before** threat actors exploit them, economic incentives can make scam operations unprofitable **before** they reach victims.

**prevention:** "how do we stop the attacks we can see?"

**disruption:** "how do we make the attack impossible to execute profitably?"

</div>

## The "Before Times" Urgency

If Google is right that we're in the "before times" before AI truly transforms the threat landscape, **then we need disruptive solutions deployed before that transformation completes**.

### Waiting Means:

- facing the full force of AI-powered scams with only prevention tools
- dealing with deepfakes so good that video calls can't be trusted
- experiencing automated, personalized fraud at unprecedented scale
- losing the window to establish economic barriers before threats evolve

### Acting Now Means:

- **economic infrastructure in place** before AI scams peak
- **disruptive tools normalized** across communication channels
- **network effects building** as more people adopt economic defense
- **compounding advantage** as scam economics become increasingly impossible

## Final Thought: From Intel to Action

Google's disruption unit represents the future of cybersecurity: **moving from knowing about threats to actively eliminating them**.

For the scam crisis, this means:

- We already know the scale ($442 billion/year)
- We already know the tactics (AI-powered personalization)
- We already know detection is failing (57% victimization despite 73% confidence)

**What we need is disruption, not more intelligence.**

KarmaCall exists because we believe the same thing Google's leader said: **The goal cannot be to be the smartest people in the room about scams. The goal has to be making scams economically impossible.**
