# Founder Update: Why We Are Introducing Ads

I want to share a candid update about a change you might notice in KarmaCall: you will start seeing ads in the free tier. This is not a decision I made lightly, and I want to be clear about why it is happening.

## The short version

Google Play now expects apps that work with cryptocurrency to meet stricter compliance requirements tied to anti-money laundering rules and money transmitter licensing. To keep KarmaCall available on Google Play, we are moving from a custodial model to a non-custodial model where users control their own funds.

That migration is a major build. It touches wallet architecture, payout flows, and long-term compliance. Ads help us fund the transition while keeping the app free and accessible.

## What changes and what does not

We are adding ads to support the transition. Our mission stays the same: protect your attention, block spam, and pay you for the interruptions you did not ask for.

We also remain privacy-focused. Our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) describes how ad partners may collect standard device identifiers and interaction data to serve ads and measure performance. We do not sell personal information outside of what is described there, and we will continue to minimize data collection.

## What happens next

We will share progress updates as the non-custodial migration takes shape. If you have questions, I want to hear them. Thank you for helping us get to the next chapter of KarmaCall.
