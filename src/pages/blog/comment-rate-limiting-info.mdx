**Our comment rate limiting system is designed to create a healthy, respectful discussion environment while preventing spam and abuse.** This guide explains how it works and how to make the most of our comment system.

## Why Do We Limit Comments?

Rate limiting helps us maintain a quality discussion environment for everyone. Here's why we've implemented these measures:

- **Spam Prevention:** Automated systems and bad actors often try to flood comment sections with repetitive or promotional content.
- **Quality Discussion:** By encouraging thoughtful, spaced-out responses, we promote more meaningful conversations.
- **Server Protection:** Rate limiting helps prevent our servers from being overwhelmed by excessive requests.
- **User Experience:** A cleaner comment section benefits everyone by reducing noise and improving readability.

## How It Works

Our rate limiting system is designed to be fair and transparent:

### Current Limits

- **3 comments** per 1-minute window
- **5-minute cooldown** if limit is exceeded
- Limits reset automatically after the time window

## What Happens When You Hit the Limit?

If you exceed the comment limit, here's what you can expect:

1. The "Post Comment" button will be disabled and show "Rate Limited"
2. A small info button (?) will appear next to the disabled button
3. You'll need to wait for the cooldown period to expire
4. The system will automatically re-enable commenting when you're ready

## Best Practices for Commenting

To make the most of our comment system and avoid hitting limits:

- **Take your time:** Craft thoughtful responses rather than rapid-fire comments
- **Edit before posting:** Review your comment before submitting to avoid needing corrections
- **Combine thoughts:** If you have multiple points, consider putting them in a single comment
- **Be respectful:** Quality over quantity leads to better discussions

## Technical Details

For those interested in the technical implementation:

- Rate limiting is tracked per user account
- Limits are stored locally and reset automatically
- The system uses a sliding window approach for fairness
- No permanent penalties - limits always reset
