## The Two Biggest Additions

- **Persistent reliability of spam/scam call protection**
- **No visual foreground notification is necessary anymore**

The thing that excites me most, is being able to focus on adding new features that are applied to both iOS and Android at the same time. We're not there yet, but our team has gotten so much stronger in our front-end skills.

## Version Roadmap

### v4.0.0 - Android Test Track

**v4.0.0 is released on a test track for Android. Testers will enjoy its main features:** (persistent call blocking and rewards payouts per call) while we work on completing the secondary features (referrals, call history management, reward redemptions, etc.).

### v4.1.0 - Complete Android Version

**v4.1.0 will be reserved for the fully complete version on Android.**

### v4.2.0 - iOS Production Ready

**v4.2.0 will bring our iOS app up to production.** At that point, we'll be fully on Kotlin Multiplatform and can focus on bringing the long awaited features, such as...

## Upcoming Features

### Custom Rates for Different Senders

**Set your own rates for different types of callers.** Want to charge telemarketers $50 but only charge your dentist $1? You'll be able to do that.

### Flow State Protection

One of the most important aspects of KarmaCall is protecting your flow state. **Flow state is that magical zone where you're completely absorbed in your work, creativity flows effortlessly, and you lose track of time.** It's when you do your best work, solve complex problems, and feel most fulfilled.

But flow state is fragile. **A single interruption can shatter hours of deep work.** Research shows it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully refocus after an interruption. For knowledge workers, this means spam calls aren't just annoying – they're productivity killers.

KarmaCall's upcoming Flow State Protection feature will learn your work patterns and automatically adjust protection levels. During your most productive hours, even legitimate calls will require higher deposits to reach you. **Because your flow state is worth protecting.**

## Our Philosophy: Eliminating Micro-Distractions

We believe that **micro-distractions are the silent productivity killer of our time.** It's not just the big interruptions that matter – it's the constant low-level anxiety of knowing your phone might ring at any moment with a spam call.

Even when you don't answer spam calls, they create what we call "cognitive overhead" – a background mental load that reduces your ability to focus deeply. **KarmaCall eliminates this overhead entirely.**

When you know that every call reaching your phone has paid to be there, you can answer with confidence. No more screening calls, no more anxiety about interruptions, no more broken flow states. **Just pure, uninterrupted focus when you need it most.**
