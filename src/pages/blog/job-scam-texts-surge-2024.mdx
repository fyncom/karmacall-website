**Job scam texts have exploded in 2024, becoming the second most common type of fraud after online shopping scams.** Americans lost over $470 million to job scams in 2023, and the numbers are climbing as AI makes these attacks more sophisticated and convincing.

## The Scale of the Problem

Job scam texts have reached epidemic proportions in 2024. According to the Federal Trade Commission, Americans lost over **$470 million to job scams in 2023**, and early data suggests 2024 will be even worse.

### Why Job Scams Work So Well

Job scams exploit our most basic human needs: financial security and purpose. When someone is unemployed or underemployed, they're in a vulnerable state. Scammers know this and craft messages that seem like lifelines.

## The AI Revolution in Fraud

What makes 2024 different is the integration of AI into scam operations. Modern job scam texts are no longer obviously fake. They're personalized, professionally written, and often reference real companies and job markets.

### Personalization at Scale

AI allows scammers to create thousands of unique, personalized messages per hour. They can reference your location, recent job applications, and even your career history scraped from social media.

## An Economic Solution to a Digital Problem

Traditional spam filters and blocking apps are losing the arms race against AI-powered scams. We need a fundamentally different approach—one that makes scamming economically unsustainable.

### The Power of Refundable Deposits

Imagine if every text message cost the sender a small, refundable deposit—say $0.01. For legitimate businesses, this cost is negligible and gets refunded when you engage positively. For scammers sending millions of messages, it becomes prohibitively expensive.

## How KarmaCall Protects You

KarmaCall implements this economic approach for phone calls and is expanding to text messages. When someone wants to contact you, they put up a small deposit. If it's spam, you keep the money. If it's legitimate, they get it back.

### Example: Mass Scam Economics

**Current cost:** Send 1 million scam texts for ~$50

**With $0.25 deposits:** Send 1 million texts for $250,000

**Result:** Scamming becomes economically unviable

## Preserving Legitimate Communication

The beauty of refundable deposits is that they don't penalize legitimate senders. **Real job recruiters, businesses, and individuals get their money back when recipients engage positively.** Only bad actors lose their deposits.

### Legitimate Use Cases That Benefit

- **Job recruiters** reaching out to potential candidates
- **Sales professionals** making initial contact with prospects
- **Emergency services** contacting individuals in crisis situations
- **Healthcare providers** sending appointment reminders

## KarmaCall's Implementation

KarmaCall is pioneering this approach for phone calls, and FynCom is developing the broader infrastructure for all types of digital communication. **Our system makes it economically impossible to profit from mass scamming while rewarding users for protecting themselves.**
