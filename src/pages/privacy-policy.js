                venture is change the way your data is processed. Our goal is to convince 3rd parties that we would all be much better off if 3rd parties just
                directly paid you for your data, as opposed to the status quo where companies make their riches by selling your data without paying you for it.
                The KarmaCall app is the first example of how we&#x27;ll accomplish that, by ignoring any unknown calls unless they come with a deposit. By
                joining us, you are reducing the supply of phone numbers that answer unknown calls and that will increase the demand for phone numbers that do
                answer those calls. The only time third-parties will buy your data is if you set your own market rate and they agree to pay YOU that market rate
                through our platform.

              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to

              recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
              that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
              future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
